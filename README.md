This is to practice some foundational HTML and CSS and build off of it. 


The first thing I wanted to do was have some sections and layers between them, I find this extremely eye catching.
I went to https://app.haikei.app and messed around with their svg waves for this. 
All I had to do after was download svg file and position it with the right background layer.
